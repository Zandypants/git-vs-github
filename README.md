# CLI (Command Line Interface) commands
- ls -> lists contents of current directory
- cd -> change directory (follow with name of directory)
- mkdir -> makes a new directory
- touch -> create a file if it doesnt exist, or update existing file's timestamp 

# Git vs GitHub

- git init -> allows a project to use git commands
- git status -> shows what has been added/changed/deleted since your last commit
- git add -> move files/folders to the staging area
- git commit -> takes everything from the staging area and makes it permanent
- git diff -> shows the difference in files since the last commit
- git remote -> shows connections to other places
    - add -> creates a new connection
    - -v -> verbose = more details
- git push -> copies your code to wherever you're sending it (remote)
    - nickname of the remote
    - branch name

- 3 different stages
    - working directory
    - staging area
    - project
